This is my first TOP Project. I am very proud, that I finally came to this point. I needed to download and set up a linux virtual machine, learn to use terminal and to use basic git github stuff, all of this was new to me and I did it. Also, TOP gave me a feeling of an purpose, which I am very thankful for. It helps me to keep my habits straight and even though I am not there quite yet, I feel like I am getting there. Thanks a lot, TOP community.
